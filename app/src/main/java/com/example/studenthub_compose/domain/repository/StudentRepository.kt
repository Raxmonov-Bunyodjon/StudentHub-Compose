 * StudentRepository — domain layer repository interface.

 * - Provides abstraction for working with student data.
 * - Decouples the UI and business logic layers from the data sources
 *   (e.g., Room database, REST API).
 *
 * With this interface we can:
 * - fetch all students
 * - fetch students filtered by faculty
 * - insert, update, and delete students
